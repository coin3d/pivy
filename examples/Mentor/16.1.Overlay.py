# This is an example from the Inventor Mentor,
# chapter 16, example 1.
#
# This example shows how to use the overlay planes with the
# viewer components. By default color 0 is used for the
# overlay planes background color (clear color), so we use
# color 1 for the object. This example also shows how to
# load the overlay color map with the wanted color.
